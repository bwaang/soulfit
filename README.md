# SoulFit Challenge

An application to track the Soulfit statistics.

## Installation

If you would like a local copy of this project please navigate to the directory where you would like to clone it and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/bwaang/soulfit
cd soulfit
```

Pull up your favorite editor and start developing: I would suggest [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or the newly developed [Atom](https://atom.io)

## Setup

  * The best way to get setup it to follow the guides at the [angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial) website.
  * I would also suggest to use a scaffolding tool like [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) as well to get started.
  * For frontend development familiarize yourself with [less](http://lesscss.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
  * Also make sure to run `bower install` and `npm install` so you get all the dependencies that are not found in this repository
  * Please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/bwaang/soulfit/wiki) for more development information.
