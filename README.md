# SoulFit Challenge

An application to track the Soul Fit statistics for Gracepoint Riverside

## Installation

If you would like a local copy of this project please navigate to the directory where you would like to clone it and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/bwaang/soulfit
cd soulfit
```

Pull up your favorite editor to maintain it I would suggest [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) for Mac or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows

## Setup

The best way to get setup it to follow the guides at the [angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial) website.

I would also suggest to use a scaffolding tool like [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) as well to get started.

For frontend development familiarize yourself with [less](http://lesscss.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
